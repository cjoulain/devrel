Keeping the spirit of OSS and npm, my goal is to share as much as possible on our developer relations framework. It's in no means an exhaustive documentation and since I just joined, clearly a work-in-progress.

In the meantime, feel free to submit issues for ideas about how you would like us to interact with our community online and offline. Keep in mind that our role isn't just about outreach, it's even more about being your voice inside the company and for the npm project.
